Hi! My name is Jaimin, and I wanted to make this as a personal website. My primary use case was to host a blog where I can write about things I'm up to, but I figured having an all-in-one personal website where I could include projects I'm working on, books I'm reading, textbooks I'm working through, and so on would be more conducive to what I wanted to achieve from this, and maybe more fun.

Feel free to poke around, thanks for dropping by!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
