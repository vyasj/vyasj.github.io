So this is my first blog post here. I'm not too sure what I'm hoping to accomplish with this website, but I wanted to create a blog so that I could make regular updates on things I'm working on. I'm not really expecting anyone to really read these, but I'll try to make posts about academic things like projects I'm working on, papers I've read, and textbooks I'm working through.

Part of the purpose of this is to keep me accountable, but we'll see how well it does that.

Anyway, expect some posts soon, and thanks for visiting!
